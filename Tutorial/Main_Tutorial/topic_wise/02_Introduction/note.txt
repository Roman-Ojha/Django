*) Django:
    -> Django is a free, open-source Python based High-Level Web Framework
    -> It follows the Model View Template(MVT) architectural pattern.
    -> It was originally created by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison.
    -> It was created on 2003
    -> Provide SQLite Database by Default

*) What we can build with Django:
    -> We can build High End web application
    -> It encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design

*) Django Project:
    -> A Django Project may contain multiple Project Application, which means a group of application and files is called as Django Project.
    -> Single or Group of application create a Django Project
    -> EX:
        SchoolProject:
        -> Registration App
        -> Fees App
        -> Exam App
        -> Attendance App
        -> Result App

*) Django Directory Structure:
    -> after create Project ex project name is 'schoolProject' then:
        -> schoolProject (Outer project folder/Root Directory)
            -> schoolProject (Inner project folder)
                -> __init__.py (The folder which contains __init__.py file si considered as a python package)
                -> asgi.py (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a spiritual successor to WSGI, intended to provide a standard interface between async-capable Python web servers, frameworks, and application. ASGI provides standard for both asynchronous and synchronous apps.
                -> settings.py (This file contains all the information or data about project settings EX: Database Config, Template, Installed Application, Validators, Middleware etc..)
                -> urls.py (This file contains information of url attached with application).
                -> wsgi.py (Web Server Gateway Interface, Is a specification that describes how a web server communicates which web application, and how web applications can be chained together to process on request. WSGI Provided a standard for synchronous Python apps.)
            -> manage.py (manage.py is automatically created in each Django Project. It is Django's command-line utility also set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable so that it points to your project's setting.py file. Generally, when working on a single Django project, it's easier ot use manage.py that django-admin.) 
            -> __pycache__ (create cache for project files for fast load)
            -> db.sqlite3 (default django database)

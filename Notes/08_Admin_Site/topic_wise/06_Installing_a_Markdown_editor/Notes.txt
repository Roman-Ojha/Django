        -> https://djangopackages.org/packages/p/django-summernote/

    => Now register inside 'settings.py':
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            'django_summernote'
        ]
    => in addition to that we have to add new path inside './core/urls.py'
    => Summer Note also provide facility so that we can also implement images so we will create 'media\django-summernote' folder
    => Now we will going to add the base root directory path inside 'settings.py' file:
        MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
        MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media/')
    => python manage.py migrate

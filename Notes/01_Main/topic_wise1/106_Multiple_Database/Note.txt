-> Most commonly we will use to setup 1 database and connect Django application with that 1 database, and Django will send the Queries directly to that database
-> But when we will setup multiple database django will no longer have an idea which database to select
-> './02_Router_In_between.png'
-> So the idea is to create the Database router and in that router we will going describe what database are available for django application to connect to.
-> What we use to do to query on the database before is like this:
    -> <Model>.objects.all()
-> But now we are having multiple database so we will going to query like this:
    -> <Model>.objects.using('<database>').all()
    -> And this information is going to the 'Router' and router chose which database to use.

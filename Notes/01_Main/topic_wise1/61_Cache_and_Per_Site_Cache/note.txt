*) Per-site-cache
    => first configure it on './config/settings.py'
    => then run:
        -> python manage.py migrate
        -> python manage.py createcachetable
    => after that our cache get setup
    => now when ever the request happen in that case first it will check does the request site exist on cache or not
    -> if doesn't exist then it will generate code of that site and then store into the cache and return that page as response
    -> after that if someone again try to visit the same page in that case, first it will check on cache if exist then it will response that page
    -> because it is not being generate again it will be much faster

    *) Filesystem cache
        -> we will store the Per-site on './cache' folder
    
    *) Local memory Cache
        -> NOTE: don't use this cache in production

    => we have to clear those case that get expire

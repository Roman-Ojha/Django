=> We don't really have to create separate tables for authentication like for Student and Teacher
=> Because while authentication they share the same information like 'username' & 'password'
=> If we will have one table which will contain the common information of all the user which is 'username' and 'password'
=> So we can create the single table and manage the role like 'student' & 'teacher' role and assigning that particular user to the different groups which will full fill our authentication & authorization

*) Steps:
    -> python manage.py makemigration
    -> python manage.py migrate

1. Create Super Users
-> python manage.py createsuperuser
    -> if we will do that then it will store the user data into 'auth_user' table

2. Change password
    -> you can change the password of the user from '/admin' site

3. Creating User:
    -> for that you just have to add the user from '/admin' site
    -> by default if we create the user then it will not have any permission and any authorization
    -> staff status: 0
    -> superuser: 0

4. Permissions and Authorization
    => if user is 'superuser' then it will automatically have all the user permissions
    => 'staff status' user can login into /admin site
        -> but by default 'staff status' don't have any permissions

    => we can add and remove the permission of the user inside the '/admin' site

5. Groups
    -> we can create a group and add the user in that group
    -> if group have some permission that user only don't have then also user will get those permission that group allow it to do


=> NOTE: we can create our own permission and authorization
